# About
📚 **Welcome to the CogSys Learning Resources Repo** <br>
This repository collects helpful materials, tips, and recommendations from students for students in the Cognitive Systems Master's program. Whether you're looking for guidance on a tough course, useful links, or just want to get a head start—this is a place to share and grow together. <br>
You don’t need to go through everything at once—just explore what’s relevant to you right now, and see what’s helped your fellow students along the way. <br><br>
If any link is broken, please help maintaining this shared resource by submitting an Issue. 

🌱 **A Note from Your Student Council (FSR)** <br>
Not every program has a student council—so if you’ve benefited from the work of the FSR, please don’t take it for granted. We’re a small group of current CogSys students working to support and connect our community. If you have the capacity, please consider giving back: <br>
💡 Contribute to this repo by submitting a pull request, <br>
🤝 Or join the FSR and help shape the future of our program. <br><br>
Let’s keep CogSys an evergreen, collaborative, and welcoming community. 🌿

💬 **Share Your Experience – Help Others Learn Better!** <br>
Besides resources listed in README, there is a separate file of personal feedback or "testimony" in the repo. We invite you to make a pull request to add your own comments: Describe how the resource helped you personally or why you found it useful (e.g., clarified a tough topic, great project ideas, beginner-friendly). <br>

👥 These reflections are incredibly valuable for other students navigating the same challenges.

📌 Make a pull request to:
- Add new resources you found helpful.
- Share your experience with existing resources.

Let’s build a resource hub that grows through shared experience, not just links. 🌱
